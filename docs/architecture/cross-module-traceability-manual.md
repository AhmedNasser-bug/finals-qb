# System Overview

## Cross-Module Traceability

This document maps the architectural component interactions across frontend client apps, backend services, and cloud infra targets.

### Frontend Client Apps & Next.js App Router
The frontend application uses Next.js 16 with the App Router.
- `app/layout.tsx`: The root layout of the application, managing global styles and context providers.
- `app/page.tsx`: The home page module where initial routing and interaction happens.
- `app/subjects/page.tsx`: Subject management page.
- Domain-specific components are localized in `components/mold/` (e.g. `HomeScreen`, `GameRunner`, `SubjectImporter`).

### State Management & Contexts
State dependencies and core logics flow from contexts and stores:
- `lib/game-engine.tsx`: Provides the `useGameEngine` hook and `GameEngineProvider` context, driving game state reducer and timers.
- `lib/achievement-engine.tsx`: Provides the `useAchievements` hook and `AchievementProvider` context, evaluating conditions and unlocking logic.
- `active-subject-store.ts`: Stores the active subject in the session scope.
- `subject-store.ts`: Handles the local subject inventory state.

### Cloud Infrastructure Targets
The multi-tenant sandbox environment leverages Docker.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Defines the local developer multi-tenant containers via `node:alpine`. Instances like `tenant-a` and `tenant-b` boot Next.js in development mode.
- Persistent volumes are mapped to Next.js host environments avoiding direct container lock-ins.

### Interaction Flow
1. Next.js server components render the skeleton.
2. The user interacts with Client Components. Contexts from `lib/game-engine.tsx` and stores like `lib/active-subject-store.ts` mutate based on actions.
3. Persistent states sync down into `localStorage` leveraging persistence controllers.

### Component Interaction Mapping
- **Frontend App ↔ Local Storage**: Client components read/write to `localStorage` using hooks like `useSubjectStore` and persistent state managers to ensure offline availability.
- **Backend Services**: Next.js Server Components handle secure, pre-rendered HTML delivery. Server Actions (if any) provide structured API points.
- **Docker Multi-Tenant Sandbox**: Containerized tenants mount isolated `.next` output directories (`.next-tenant-a`, `.next-tenant-b`) avoiding state bleeding across the local orchestrator environments.

## Interfaces and Data Pipelines

This document maps the interface properties and data pipelines for the MOLD V2 application.

### Core Data Models
Defined heavily in `lib/types/mold-types.ts`, the principal models dictating the domain boundaries are:
- `FullSubjectData`: Represents the fully hydrated model of a subject being tested or managed.
- `Question`: Defines varying structures like MCQ (`MCQOption`) or TrueFalse questions.
- `GameState`: The current atomic instance of a game run, capturing `GamePhase`, active scores, and timelines.
- `AchievementCondition`: Logical evaluations determining progression capabilities.
- `Terminology`: Used for learning modes, detailing specific concepts or terms (`TerminologyEntry`).

### Interface Properties
- **Subject Validation Interface (`SubjectSchema`)**: Validates inbound JSON to ensure the structure strictly conforms to the `FullSubjectData` type, guaranteeing stability across the persistence layer.
- **Game Engine Dispatch Interface**: Component interactions dispatch structured objects (e.g. `{ type: 'ANSWER', payload: ... }`) ensuring predictability within the reducer pipeline.

### Data Persistence Pipeline
`lib/subject/subject-persistence.ts` operates as the primary data pipeline bridging active memory and browser storage constraints.
- `validateSubjectData(raw: unknown)`: Secures inbound JSON parsing constraints, avoiding schema mismatch.
- `loadSubjects()` and `saveSubjects()`: Interfacing points with Next.js environment mapping directly to local persistence layers.

### Game State Reducer Pipeline
Within `lib/game-engine.tsx`, state mutations operate within a unidirectional data flow. Actions such as answer selections trigger state shifts that are then broadcasted back up to listeners mapped via `useGameEngine`.
