# Cloud Infrastructure

## Cross-Module Traceability

### Cloud Infrastructure Targets
The multi-tenant sandbox environment leverages Docker.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Defines the local developer multi-tenant containers via `node:alpine`. Instances like `tenant-a` and `tenant-b` boot Next.js in development mode.
- Persistent volumes are mapped to Next.js host environments avoiding direct container lock-ins.
