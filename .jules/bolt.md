2024-05-18 - [Optimize duplicate ID resolution], Learning: While loops containing Set lookups can be O(N^2) if the final generated IDs consistently collide with the existing data set. Tracking the counter externally in a Map bypasses the need to regenerate previously-collided strings., Action: Updated duplicate ID resolution in `components/mold/home/add-questions-wizard.tsx` to use `Map` for both questions and flashcards.
## 2024-06-25 - [Optimize optimizePackageImports]
**Learning:** Next.js experimental `optimizePackageImports` is highly effective at reducing Turbopack build latency when used for barrel file exports or packages with many sub-modules that aren't cleanly tree-shaken by default.
**Action:** Configured `optimizePackageImports` in `next.config.mjs` for `recharts`, `date-fns`, `lucide-react`, and other barrel-file dependencies.

## 2024-07-02 - [Optimize Array.indexOf inside Array.sort]
**Learning:** Using `Array.indexOf()` inside an `Array.sort()` comparator function results in an unexpected O(N^2 log N) performance bottleneck since the linear scan repeats on every comparison.
**Action:** Always pre-calculate order arrays into a `Map` cache (hash map) to achieve O(1) index lookups during iterative or sorting loops.
